Equivalent to: program_with_alternative_one_line_without_parenthese.docopt

Both should generate the same AST? (for error handling no, because the syntax is diffrent and the token too)
In original docopt it was normalized first: `FormalUsage(section string) (string, error)`

Usage:
  my_program run
  my_program jump
