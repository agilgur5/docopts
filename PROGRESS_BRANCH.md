# current work in PROGRRESS

We are currently studying doctop-go lib and see how it works in go.

## grammar programming

* ~~Testing https://github.com/alecthomas/participle~~ will be dropped
* ~~make `--print-ast` work in doctops (using legacy `docopt.go` lib)~~ modified OK
* cmd/doctop-analyze parse our grammar and build ast
* modify `scanner/scanner.go` to read our docopt token
* add grammar branch documentation and steps
